# Hackathon : 2-D Breakout Game


In the 2D Breakout game, you need to break all the bricks using a bouncing ball, a ball that you need to prevent from leaving the game area using the paddle.

 You have to be able to control the paddle using the left and the right arrows on the keyboard or using your mouse, due to collision detection logic when the ball hits a wall it will change the direction.
 
 when the ball hits a brick, the brick will disappear and then increment the player's score.
 
 The player has 3 lives, when he loses a life, we reset the ball position and give him a chance to continue playing, when he loses all the 3 lives, it's a game over, we show him a game over message, and a "play again" button to play over.
 
 To win the game, the player has to break all the bricks on each level, and he has to complete 5 levels, when he passes from a level to another, new functionality will be added like increasing speed, decreasing the size of the paddle, life increasing, obstacle introducing, etc.
 
I have also implemented some sounds in the game and created a button for when you want to turn ON/OFF the sounds.
